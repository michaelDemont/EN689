        He does a good job, is a real expert but sometimes remains too much within that role.
        He meets the required deadlines, is correct, conscientious and deliberates alternatives to come to well-considered conclusions.
        \n\nHowever he has a introverted attitude that can pose a problem for the team dynamics.
        Furthermore, his communication is frequently rather unconventional. He is very focused on his own work and responsibilities and much less
        on contact or discussion with others.
        He is always available but does not take the initiative.</string>
